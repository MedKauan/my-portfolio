        Iâ€™m a sparkling, insightful and imaginative young web developer who is
        achieving big goals, and charting paths to do so. Iâ€™m used to work
        alongside other many types of IT professionals and always targeting to
        the very highest standards. I have a high knowledge mainly in
        accessibility, usability, and Frameworks to front-end development.
        Within a company I often want to be noticed and feel like Iâ€™m making a
        good difference in my team. So, I always direct a massive energy needed
        to the project.
